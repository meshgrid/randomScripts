Script descriptions: 
-------------------------


makeScrotCopyToClipboard.sh
-------------------------

Takes a screenshot of an area of the screen, saves it into /home/Pictures/Screenshots/<date-time>.png and also copies it to the clipboard. The script can then be tied to a key binding - I tried to make this similar to the Snipping tool in Windows. Normally, already "gnome-screenshot -a -c" should be enough, but for some reason it wouldn't work after a restart.
